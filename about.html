      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>I was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, but grew up in the northwest Georgia town of Dalton. After graduating high school in 2019, I began studying Physics at Dalton State College as part of the REPP Program.</p>
      <p>I graduated from Dalton State College with an Associate Degree in 2021, and transferred to Kennesaw State University that fall. After various major changes and semesters taken off due to personal reasons, I am currently on track to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>
      <p>I began working at the age of 15 in a small, family-owned restaurant. After that I worked variou retail positions and interned for a utility company through my time at Dalton State. I began working in the non-profit space after I changed my major to Political Science, and have been in this sector ever since. I am currently looking to transition into something related to my field of study, so I am actively working on projects and doing additional learning aside from my school coursework.</p>
      <p>I currently reside in south Cobb County, with my partner, our son, and our two dogs. In my free time I usually read books, play video games, or sit outside and enjoy some fresh air.</p>
